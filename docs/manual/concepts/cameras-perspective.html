                <h2>Cameras</h2>
                <p>Camera elements define a position and direction from which the scene is viewed, and a viewing angle (<i>field of view</i>) for perspective rendering. Cameras also define near and far <i>clipping planes</i> to create a viewing volume outside of which no objects are visible. The following fragment defines a perspective camera with a 60 degree field of view, a near clipping plane at z=.01 units, and a far clipping plane at z=100000 units.</p>

        <code>
            &lt;camera fov='60deg' near='.01' far='100000'&gt;&lt;/camera&gt;
        </code>

                <p>Both perspective and orthographic camera types are supported.
                </p>

                <p>A GLAM document does not require a camera element to render the scene. If no camera element is present, the implementation provides a default perspective camera element with default values.
                </p>

                <h2>The viewport and viewing transformations</h2>
                <p>The GLAM scene is ultimately rendered to a 2D surface within the client window, also known as the <i>viewport</i>. The viewport 
                    is a a rectangular subregion corresponding to the entire bounds of the GLAM root element.</p>

                <p>The camera parameters, taken together with the viewport definition, determine how 3D graphics are transformed from 
                    3D world space into 2D screen space. For perspective cameras, a <i>perspective projection</i> is performed as depicted in Figure 1.
                    </p>
