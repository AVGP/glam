            <p>
                GLAM renders scenes using WebGL. By default, GLAM scenes are rendered in mono, but this behavior can be overridden using the &lt;renderer&gt; element and setting the <strong>type</strong> attribute to one of the following values:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        "cardboard" - render side-by-side WebGL with a 90-degree camera field-of-view, suitable for Google Cardboard devices
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "rift" – use Oculus Rift stereo rendering with barrel distortion, as implemented by WebVR-enabled browsers (currently only Firefox and Chrome)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "standard" – standard rendering using WebGL; this is the default.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                For example, the following GLAM document fragment renders a scene in side-by-side stereo for Google Cardboard:
            </p>

<code>
&lt;glam&gt;
  &lt;scene&gt;
    &lt;renderer type="cardboard"&gt;&lt;/renderer&gt;
    &lt;controller type="deviceOrientation"&gt;&lt;/controller&gt;
    &lt;background id="sb1" class="skybox"&gt;&lt;/background&gt;
  &lt;/scene&gt;
&lt;/glam&gt;

</code>            
                In the future, GLAM may support Perhaps other rendering models such as physically based and deferred.

                <h2>Compositing and Backgrounds</h2>

                <p>
                    GLAM scenes can be rendered in multiple layers that are blended (composited) back-to-front. Currently this is only used to render custom backgrounds via the &lt;background&gt; element but it may be used to support additional layer types in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Background elements use cube map or spherical images to render an infinitely far away backgrounds that re-orient with changes to the camera's orientation. The following example creates a spherical background for the scene using the &lt;background&gt; element and the <<strong>sphere-image</strong> CSS property:
                </p>
