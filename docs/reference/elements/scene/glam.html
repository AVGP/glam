		<h2>Creating</h2>


		<h3>&lt;glam&gt;</h3>
		<div>
			This creates the root GLAM document. Under the covers, this instantiates a GLAM application object that manages Three.js renderer and scene creation, window sizing and other events, as well as the <strong>requestAnimationFrame</strong> run loop. In the current implementation, the root &lt;glam&gt; tag must be created as a child of a &lt;div&gt; element. This restriction will probably go away soon.
