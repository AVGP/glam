        <h1>The Transformation Hierarchy</h1>

            <section>

                <p>
                    Elements in the scene graph inherit the transform properties of their ancestors. All visual and transformable elements are transformed by composing their transforms (known as <i>local space</i> transforms) with the transforms of their ancestor grouping elements to create the final transformation of the element in world space. This nested composition of transforms is known as the <i>transformation hierarchy</i>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The following example creates a 'group' element, GROUP1, that is rotated by 30 degrees about its Y-axis. The mesh that is a direct descendant of GROUP1 is thus also rotated. A second group, GROUP2 is also a descendant of GROUP1. GROUP2 is also rotated about the Y-axis by 30 degrees, and is additionally scaled on the X-axis. GROUP2 contains a child mesh element that, because of the hierarchy of transforms under which it is defined, will be rotated about the Y-axis and scaled along the X-axis.
                </p>
                <code>
&lt;style&gt;
#GROUP1 {
    transform: rotateY(30deg);
}
#GROUP2 {
    transform: translate3d(2, 1, 0) scaleX(2);
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;glam&gt;
    &lt;scene&gt;
        &lt;group id='GROUP1'&gt;
            &lt;mesh&gt;&lt;/mesh&gt;
            &lt;group id='GROUP2'&gt;
                &lt;mesh&gt;&lt;/mesh&gt;
            &lt;/group&gt;
        &lt;/group&gt;
    &lt;/scene&gt;
&lt;/glam&gt;
