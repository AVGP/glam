            <h1>Navigation and Viewing</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Camera controllers</h2>
                <p>
                    Rather than requiring the programmer to implement mouse-based control of a scene, for example to rotate a model or walk through a scene, GLAM provides built-in behavior in the form of <i>camera controllers</i>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        FPS controller – first-person navigation: move the user through a scene with mouse, touch device and keyboard
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Model controller – orbit the camera around the center of the scene/model using the mouse, touch device and keyboard
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Device orientation controller – use HTML5 device orientation API to detect changes in orientation via the mobile device's accelerometer and gyroscope and rotate the camera
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rift controller – use the WebVR API for Oculus Rift to detect changes in the headset's position and orientation and move/rotate the camera
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Controllers are added to a scene using the 'controller' element. This element has a <strong>type</strong> attribute that defines the interaction type, with valid values of "FPS" and "model".
                </p>
                <p>By default, GLAM creates a camera controller with <strong>type</strong> "model" so that simple scenes and models can be rotated with the mouse or touch device.
                </p>
            </section>
