    Why GLAM?
  </h1>

    <p class="p17">

With WebGL, the browser is now a complete 3D platform. Powerful APIs provide everything we need: graphics, compositing, animation, threading, networking... making mind-blowing connected 3D applications possible. The API approach provides maximum flexibility - render whatever you want without the browser needing to support new objects - but the pendulum has swung too far. It takes lines and lines of JavaScript and JSON to make even the simplest 3D content. And there is no easy way to style your content once you've created it.<br /><br />

Let's say you want to create a cube with a texture map (image) on its surface. Using the WebGL API, that's about 300 lines of code. (Really.) You have to create buffers, load textures, set states, write shaders, and finally make drawing calls. It's a ton of work, and it's in an alien language full of unfamiliar concepts. So, you turn to Three.js to make it easier. Now, in about forty lines of code, you have accomplished the same thing, and are working with high level, easy to understand graphics objects. Cool... but think about it: forty lines of JavaScript code to make a cube. And that cube doesn't animate, you can't use your mouse to rotate it, and you can't change its appearance with a style sheet. Wouldn't it be great if you could just say<br /><br />

&lt;cube&gt;<br /><br />
and a cube appears on the page? You bet it would.<br /><br />

Web developers need a simple way to create 3D content in pages that can be styled and programmed like any other page content. We need a 3D markup language for the web. We need... GLAM!<br /><br />

    Why Now?
  </h1>

    <p class="p17">

WebGL is ubiquitous. With the release of iOS8, WebGL now runs on all major desktop

and mobile browsers, across all devices. That's 3 billion seats ready for connected 3D

applications, everywhere, powered by JavaScript. This is an incredible opportunity to

change the face of computing.<br /><br />

The last few years have seen an explosion of interest in building WebGL. But there is a

huge skill gap. 3D is inherently hard, yes; we have that extra dimension to worry about,

plus cameras, shaders, skinned animations, etc... But there is no reason to make 3D

harder than it has to be. For the simple 3D stuff, there should be a simple way to do it,

with an approach that is familiar to the millions of web developers ready to try something

new. Until GLAM, this didn't exist. GLAM is here to make your 3D job easier, so you can

focus on the fun part: building a killer 3D web app.

    How Do I Use GLAM?
  </h1>

    <p class="p17">


To add GLAM to your application, simply include either the debug or minified version of

the library:<br /><br />

&lt;script src="pathtoglam/glam.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

OR<br /><br />

&lt;script src="pathtoglamlib/glam.min.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;<br /><br />

... and then you can start adding 3D tags to your page. To see what those tags look like,

    How Do I Author GLAM?
  </h1>

    <p class="p17">

Right now, authoring GLAM requires a text editor. Someday, maybe, we'll build an

interactive tool for authoring, or at least a syntax assisted in browser editor a la JSFiddle.

To test, you will most likely need a web server ... so that you can see your texture maps

and shaders. Launching HTML files from your Finder/Explorer usually results in the

browser yakking about cross-origin restrictions.

GLAM is new. We're just getting started, and we need your help! We are looking for help

with code, content and documentation. Check out the Github repo and examples (links
